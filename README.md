# N:Signals
#### Micro signal & messaging system for Unity

N:Signals is a micro library for lightweight, strongly-typed messassing manipulation.

### Concept

- A Signal is essentially a mini-dispatcher specific to one event, with its own array of listeners.
- A Signal gives an event a concrete membership in a class.
- Listeners subscribe to real objects.
- Signals are inspired by [C# events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_syntax#Events) and [signals/slots in Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_and_slots).

## Hows

### Syntax
#### Without arguments

```C#
//FOO object
//Create signal
protected Signal m_beep = new Signal();
//Expose signal through ISignal interface (keeps Dispatch method internal)
public ISignal beep { get{ return m_beep;} }
...

//Subcribe to 'beep'
foo.beep.Add(callback);
...

//FOO object
//Notify all 'beep' subscribers.
m_beep.Dispatch();
```

#### With arguments

```C#
//As simple as without.
protected Signal<int, string> m_boop = new Signal<int, string>();
...
m_boop.Dispatch(777, "BOOP");
```

### Installation
To be used with [Unity's Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) + [Git Dependency Resolver For Unity](https://github.com/mob-sakai/GitDependencyResolverForUnity).

âš  [Git Dependency Resolver For Unity](https://github.com/mob-sakai/GitDependencyResolverForUnity) must be installed *before* in order to fetch nested git dependencies.
